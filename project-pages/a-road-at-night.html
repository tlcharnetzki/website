          <div class="body-text">I played a largely line production role on this project - coordinating interviews, shoots, and
            archival resources. Central to our approach was the commitment to telling Howard&#39;s complete story, steering away
            from a narrative solely centered on the accident. We aimed to capture the essence of his journey,
            blending personal and professional interviews to create a comprehensive and empathetic portrayal.</div>
            <div class="body-text">One of the project&#39;s key objectives was to spotlight the &quot;brotherhood of sports.&quot; This translated
into dedicating significant airtime to Howard&#39;s former teammates who continued to support him
throughout medical challenges. My favorite part of this trailer is showing the team photo as preview to
the interviewees today. It&#39;s subtle, but really communicates the balance we were hoping to strike.</div>
